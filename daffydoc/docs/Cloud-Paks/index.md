## What is required to deploy a Cloud Pak?

Before you can deploy a Cloud Pak, you must have the following:

###  You must have a cluster running    
- An existing cluster in a supported provider
- Can be built with Daffy or any other process  
###  IBM entitlement key   
- You can obtain your existing entitlement key here:
- [https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary)

Important: if you're installing on a customer owned platform account or an on-prem customer data center, you **`MUST`** instruct your customer to register for a trial account and use their pull secret for the install if they don't own the software. Do not use your own pull secret for customer engagements.

!!! Note
      all IBMer's are entitled to an IBM Entitlement Key. Your key can **`ONLY`** be used for training and demo purposes. Do not provide your personal entitlement key to others.

If customer or business partner does not have an IBM entitlement key, go to the following link to get one (IBM Internal Link):

[IBM Trial Software Process ](https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC82Wc9PpPqf68MHHTjBpVC84RBB)
