!!! important
	To install LDAP, you need to have DB2 installed locally. Instructions [here](../DB2/)

## Obtain Software

Before you install IBM LDAP you will need to download the IBM LDAP Software and place the binary's on your Linux server.

1)   Customer can download the software via the [Passport Advantage](https://%20https//www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/pao_customer.html){target=_blank} site.

2)  Tech Sellers can download it from [IBM Internal DSW Downloads](https://w3.ibm.com/software/xl/download/ticket.wss){target=_blank}.

You will need to search for two part numbers **CN487ML** and **CN4VJML** , this is the IBM LDAP Software that will be used during the install.

Once you get the software, you will need to upload it to the Linux server where you plan to install it.

By default, it will need to be in the following location:

**/data/software/ldap**



You can override this base location (/data/software) by overriding it in your environment file.

**SOFTWARE_INSTALLS_DIR=**
