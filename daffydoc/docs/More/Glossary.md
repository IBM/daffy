## Cloud Provider

A cloud service provider is a third-party company offering a cloud-based platform, infrastructure, application, or storage services. Much like a homeowner would pay for a utility such as electricity or gas, companies typically have to pay only for the amount of cloud services they use, as business demands require.

Besides the pay-per-use model, cloud service providers also give companies a wide range of benefits. Businesses can take advantage of scalability and flexibility by not being limited to physical constraints of on-premises servers, the reliability of multiple data centers with multiple redundancies, customization by configuring servers to your preferences, and responsive load balancing that can easily respond to changing demands. Though businesses should also evaluate security considerations of storing information in the cloud to ensure industry-recommended access and compliance management configurations and practices are enacted and met.

## Cluster

Multiple computing nodes or hosts that work together to support an application or middleware such as a database. A cluster is a group of inter-connected computers or hosts that work together to support applications and middleware (e.g. databases).  In a cluster, each computer is referred to as a “node”. Unlike grid computers, where each node performs a different task, computer clusters assign the same task to each node. Nodes in a cluster are usually connected to each other through high-speed local area networks. Each node runs its own instance of an operating system. A computer cluster may range from a simple two-node system connecting two personal computers to a supercomputer with a cluster architecture. Computer clusters are often used for cost-effective high-performance computing (HPC) and high availability (HA). If a single component fails in a computer cluster, the other nodes continue to provide uninterrupted processing.  A computer cluster can provide faster processing speed, larger storage capacity, better data integrity, greater reliability and wider availability of resources. Computer clusters are usually dedicated to specific functions, such as load balancing, high availability, high performance or large-scale processing.

## Control Plane

In network routing, the control plane is the part of the router architecture that is concerned with drawing the network topology, or the information in a routing table that defines what to do with incoming packets. Control plane functions, such as participating in routing protocols, run in the architectural control element.[1] In most cases, the routing table contains a list of destination addresses and the outgoing interface(s) associated with each. Control plane logic also can identify certain packets to be discarded, as well as preferential treatment of certain packets for which a high quality of service is defined by such mechanisms as differentiated services.

Depending on the specific router implementation, there may be a separate forwarding information base that is populated by the control plane, but used by the high-speed forwarding plane to look up packets and decide how to handle them.

In computing, the control plane is the part of the software that configures and shuts down the data plane.[2] By contrast, the data plane is the part of the software that processes the data requests.[3] The data plane is also sometimes referred to as the forwarding plane.

The distinction has proven useful in the networking field where it originated, as it separates the concerns: the data plane is optimized for speed of processing, and for simplicity and regularity. The control plane is optimized for customizability, handling policies, handling exceptional situations, and in general facilitating and simplifying the data plane processing.[4] [5]

The conceptual separation of the data plane from the control plane has been done for years.[6] An early example is Unix, where the basic file operations are open, close for the control plane and read write for the data plane.[7]

## Domain Name System (DNS)

The Domain Name System (DNS) is the hierarchical and decentralized naming system used to identify computers, servr ices, and other resources reachable through the Internet or other Internet Protocol (IP) networks. The resource records contained in the DNS associate domain names with other forms of information. These are most commonly used to map human-friendly domain names to the numerical IP addresses computers need to locate services and devices using the underlying network protocols, but have been extended over time to perform many other functions as well.

- In a nutshell, its a system where your local computer can call other computers on the internet to translate a website name to a computer IP address.  Think of it as the internet phone book.

## DNS Registrar/Registry

A domain name **registrar** is a company that manages the reservation of Internet domain names. A domain name registrar must be accredited by a generic top-level domain (gTLD) registry or a country code top-level domain (ccTLD) registry. A registrar operates in accordance with the guidelines of the designated domain name registries.

- In a nutshell, its a company where you can buy and register a website name.   Like **"mywebsite.com"** You would now own that name and can have that name redirected to any computer IP address.

A domain name **registry** is a database of all domain names and the associated registrant information in the top level domains of the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet that enables third party entities to request administrative control of a domain name. Most registries operate on the top-level and second-level of the DNS.

- In a nutshell, its where website names are stored and has a mapping from name to IP Address.   Like **"www.mywebsite.com"** points to 169.45.45.55

## Enviornment Name/File

You may see reference to **<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>**,  this is what you name your environment and the base name of the file to store your details for that environment.

Example  **gamm01**-env.sh is your file where **gamma01** is your **<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>**

Best practice, but not required, is to name your environment the same as your cluster as this is the core of your environment.

## Ingress Operator

The Ingress Operator makes it possible for external clients to access your service by deploying and managing one or more HAProxy-based Ingress Controllers to handle routing. You can use the Ingress Operator to route traffic by specifying OpenShift Container Platform Route and Kubernetes Ingress resources. Configurations within the Ingress Controller, such as the ability to define endpointPublishingStrategy type and internal load balancing, provide ways to publish Ingress Controller endpoints.

- In a nutshell, it allows external access to your cluster and all the running pods/services/applications. Its basically an inbound router for your OpenShift Cluster.

## Master Node

The master node is responsible for running several Kubernetes processes that are absolutely necessary to run and manage the cluster properly:

- API Server: This is essentially the entry-point to the Kubernates cluster, which itself is a container. This is the process that allows communication between different Kubernetes clients and the cluster. The clients include the UI, if we are using the Kubernetes Dashboard, the API if we are running scripts, or the command-line tool. All these clients talk to the API Server to interact with the cluster.

- Controller Manager: This keeps track of the state of the cluster. It keeps an eye on the cluster and checks whether a node needs to be repaired or restarted.

- Scheduler: Scheduler ensures proper pod placement on the worker nodes based on several factors such as the available resources and the current load on the cluster.

- etcd: This is the key-value storage responsible for holding the state of the cluster at any given time. etcd has the configuration information and status data of each node in the cluster. etcd snapshots allow us to recover the whole cluster state, hence it is used in backing up and restoring a cluster.

## Pod

Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.

A Pod (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers. A Pod's contents are always co-located and co-scheduled, and run in a shared context. A Pod models an application-specific "logical host" it contains one or more application containers which are relatively tightly coupled. In non-cloud contexts, applications executed on the same physical or virtual machine are analogous to cloud applications executed on the same logical host.

As well as application containers, a Pod can contain init containers that run during Pod startup. You can also inject ephemeral containers for debugging if your cluster offers this.

## Storage Class

A StorageClass provides a way for administrators to describe the "classes" of storage they offer. Different classes might map to quality-of-service levels, or to backup policies, or to arbitrary policies determined by the cluster administrators. Kubernetes itself is unopinionated about what classes represent. This concept is sometimes called "profiles" in other storage systems.

## Worker Node

The worker nodes are the part of the Kubernetes clusters which actually execute the containers and applications on them. They have two main components, the Kubelet Service and the Kube-proxy Service.

- Kubelet Service: Each worker node has a Kubelet process running on it that allows the cluster to talk to each other and execute some tasks on the worker nodes, such as running application processes. It listens for instructions from the Api Server and manages containers running on the node.

- Kube-proxy Service: The Kube-Proxy Service is responsible for enabling communication between services within the cluster.

These worker nodes have docker containers for each application running on them. There may be a different number of containers running on each node depending on the distribution of the workload.

Worker nodes are generally more powerful than master nodes because they have to run hundreds of clusters on them. However, master nodes hold more significance because they manage the distribution of workload and the state of the cluster.
