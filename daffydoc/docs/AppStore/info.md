#What is the AppStore?

The Daffy app store is the official repository for all additional software, services, and platforms built on top of OpenShift and IBM Cloud Paks. Although these apps are maintained by developers outside of the Daffy team, they are seamlessly integrated with Daffy.

Installation is simple, most apps can be installed in a single command via the Daffy tools script.

    /data/daffy/appstore.sh

##Support Model

Apps are integrated with Daffy, but supported by developers outside of Daffy. For questions and troubleshooting, please contact the maintainers of the apps.

##Add Your App

Getting your app added to the Daffy app store is a simple process. More info on this coming soon.
